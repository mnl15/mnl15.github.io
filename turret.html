          This project was for MEAM 348, the Mechanical Engineering Junior Design Lab and I worked on it with a group of 
          eight other students, divided into subteams where I mainly worked with Maddie Magee and Roselyn Matlou on the 
          base of the turret. The goal of the project was to fabricate a complex machine that will have catastrophic failures 
          at 2.5 times the nominal load and our team chose to manufacture a turret from the video game Portal. In Portal, a 
          turret will open its wings to show that it is activated and therefore, our turret's main purpose was to open and 
          close its wings, with failure modes for the chassis, wings and base.  
        </p>
        <p class="h4 ep-text">
          My subteam focused on the base of the turret which supported the body by three legs and was designed to undergo 
          torsional failure when the mass of the body was added. Given the unprecedented situation with COVID-19, we 
          were not able to fabricate and test our turret, however we used Solidworks and ANSYS to test various failure modes
          and validate integration of all the parts.

      FAILURE ANALYSIS
    </p>
    <p class="h4 ep-text">
      In order to make our failure "catastrophic" and "interesting", as stated in our lab prompt, we attempted to make the legs 
      fail in torsion rather than bending. This is a unique challenge as it is not possible currently to mathematically derive 
      this torsional failure and instead, we relied on modeling softwares (Solidworks and ANSYS) which could be validated through
      fabrication and testing.  
    </p>
    <p class="h4 ep-text">
      The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of our designs were modeled with acrylic and the nominal load for the legs was calculated 
      from the mass of the chassis, wings, and motor to be 3.095kg or a resultant force of 53.7N. The unstable model successfully 
      reached yielding stress at 45MPa at that force and the stable model only reached 15.6 MPa at the same x2.5 nominal load.

      DESIGN DECISIONS
    </p>
    <p class="h4 ep-text">
      In designing the base for the turret, we wanted to maintain the original turret's three-legged support structure, but after 
      doing an initial test with just the three legs, decided to add an a lower plate that would attach to the legs for additional support.   
    </p>
    <p class="h4 ep-text">
      Once we received an estimate of mass from the other two subteams, we were able to perform analyses with the updated load on our 
      design and saw that it would not be able to sustain the applied load. Since the load was focused on the inner circle of the upper 
      base, the design would cave in on itself and the legs would not be able to support the  localized load as the supports were at a 
      larger radius from the center. Since the highest concentration of stresses were found at the angled areas of the legs, we decided 
      to change the design toward a more tabletop design with the legs angled toward the center then extending straight toward the ground.   
    </p>
    <p class="h4 ep-text">
      After obtaining a final mass for the chassis and wings, we updated and ran our analyses on the two designs: the first with legs 
      angled out from the body and the second with legs angled inward then extending outward. While we had previously thought that the 
      first design would not be able to support the load because of the shape of the legs, when we increased the thickness of the legs 
      and analyzed both designs, they resulted in similar stress concentrations. Finally, we decided on the first design with thicker 
      legs since it was more true to the Portal turret design.
